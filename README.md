IF YOU ARE READING THIS, DO NOT PULL THE INITIAL COMMIT YET. Merge conflicts will happpen if you do.

Jetty will be required to run any of this, so be sure to get the version here: http://ycpcs.github.io/cs320-spring2016/labs/CS320_Jetty.zip

Just import Jetty into your workspace. There will be all kinds of red lines under all of the lab03 .java files, just click one and tell it to fix build path and add Jetty to the build. If it doesnt work, let me know.

Initial Commit made, update with legitimate UI will be posted later this week. 

UPDATE: 3/20/16
This is what i've put together for MS1 tomorrow. It would be best if you guys try to pull this to your home PC soon. 
If you have trouble importing this into eclipse let me know.

Jetty will be required to run any of this, so be sure to get the version here: http://ycpcs.github.io/cs320-spring2016/labs/CS320_Jetty.zip

Just import Jetty into your workspace. There will be all kinds of red lines under all of the lab03 .java files, just click one and tell it to fix build path and add Jetty to the build. If it doesnt work, let me know.
